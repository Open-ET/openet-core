OpenET - Core Functions and Tools
=================================

|version| |build|

**WARNING: This code is in development, is being provided without support, and is subject to change at any time without notification**

This repository provides core functions used by the OpenET models.

Core Components
===============

Common
------

The OpenET "common" module provides functions that are common across many of the OpenET models.  Currently these are limited to operations like cloud masking, but additional functions will be added as they are identified.

Examples of the cloud masking functions are provided in the "examples" folder.

+ `Landsat Collection 1 TOA cloud mask <examples/landsat_c1_toa_cloud_mask.ipynb>`__
+ `Landsat Collection 1 SR cloud mask <examples/landsat_c1_sr_cloud_mask.ipynb>`__
+ `Landsat Collection 2 SR cloud mask <examples/landsat_c2_sr_cloud_mask.ipynb>`__
+ `Sentinel 2 TOA cloud mask <examples/sentinel2_toa_cloud_mask.ipynb>`__

Interpolation
-------------

The OpenET "interpolate" module provides functions for interpolating the image based ET estimates from the models (primarily from Landsat images) to a daily time step then aggregating to custom time periods (such as monthly or annual).

Ensemble
--------

The OpenET "ensemble" module provides the function used to calculate the OpenET ensemble median absolute deviation (mad).

Installation
============

The OpenET core python module can be installed via pip:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install openet-core

Dependencies
============

Modules needed to run the model:

 * `earthengine-api <https://github.com/google/earthengine-api>`__

OpenET Namespace Package
========================

Each OpenET model will be stored in sub-folders of the "openet" folder (namespace).  The benefit of the namespace package is that each ET model can be tracked in separate repositories but called as a "dot" submodule of the main openet module,

.. code-block:: python

    import openet.core.common
    import openet.core.interpolate
    import openet.ssebop

Development and Testing
